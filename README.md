> Note:<br>
Any repo marked as archived are repos that I'm pretty sure I won't be touching again. Either I consider it done or some other things
caused me to not touch it again. As for any other repo not marked as archived, there's a possibility I will do something new
with them even if the last commit in that repo is years ago.
